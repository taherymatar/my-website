        <p><strong id="aboutMe">About me</strong><br>
            My full name is <span>Taher Youssef Matar</span>,
            my date of birth is 23/6/2000, I live in the city of Rafah,
            since my childhood and I love engineering, programming and the computer world
            . This is what prompted me to enroll in the Faculty of Engineering and Information
            Technology at Al-Azhar University. Currently, I am in the fourth level, the first semester,
            which is about to end, as I am supposed to be in the fourth level, the second semester,
            but I was late for a semester because of the difficult financial situation that made me I am postponing
            a semester and don't know if the financial circumstances will allow me to register next year or not,During
            these school years, I have a good programming background
            I also mentioned that I love programming and always strive to develop myself in this field and learn as much
            as possible
            to reach the stage that I have sufficient knowledge. There is no doubt that this work is developing and this
            is the reason
            why I love The field and I want to increase my knowledge and abilities myself, but when self-learning
            sometimes I do not
            continue and interrupt, and this is one of the reasons that prompted me to register in this academy.<br><br>
            <strong>Why do I want to enroll in this program</strong><br>
            I recently graduated from the asp.net technical course with you.
            At the end of the course, we were asked for a complete project serving the backend
            and frontend. My team and I did what was required in terms of the back end, which we
            learned during the course, but since none of the team members had knowledge of the front end.
            Also due to the lack of time to learn the front end or anything from it that helps us to
            accomplish what is required in the project, we did not deliver the project in terms of the
            front end, so I decided to start learning the front end as well as practice and develop 
            my skills in the back end to eventually be able to create a complete project It corresponds
            to the front end and the back end, also I would like to join this program because as 
            I mentioned I am a software engineering major and I want to learn more to become 
            a professional in my field. This program allows me to learn and follow up with you and
            benefit from the experiences of teachers for such courses. And also because I also want to
            complete my studies, that is, if I am accepted into this program, I will be able to enter
            the labor market, which will make me save tuition fees and complete my studies knowing that 
            the fate of my studies is not yet known whether I will complete it or not, and I also have a 
            goal that I would like to Seeing the labor market and learning from it as much as possible, 
            and understanding how local and international companies operate in order to gain experience 
            will allow me to enter the future to build a team or my own company, and this experience does 
            not come even after practice, and in order to succeed, I must possess sufficient knowledge 
            that qualifies me and opens the way for all these goals. 
            I think this program provides me with that knowledge. <br><br>
